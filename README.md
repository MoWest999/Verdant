# Verdant

## Background
This project was created as a response to solve a problem relating to Apple's Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and to inspire change in our community. We came up with a solution that would help not only the community but the environment as well, encouraging users to compost. By composting, pollution rates would be lowered and people who compost would have the ability to use that compost to start their own gardens to grow food and live sustainably.

## How to use the app
To use this app, type a number into the text box under "Change Goal" on the Tracker page, then input data. The bar will fill up as you add data. You can also view older data that has been added by clicking "View All Data". On the Community page, you can move around the map to see a few different compost sites around the Detroit area. The My Garden page currently has no content. As this app is still in the development process, there are a few bugs to be fixed, and users' data will not be saved upon closing and reopening the app.
